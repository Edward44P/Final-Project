My first time using GitHub so I hope you find it well presented :)

Please see https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/guillemservera/tennis for the Kaggle page that the datasets were sourced from.

Jeff Sackmann's GitHub page where he updates all tennis records: https://github.com/JeffSackmann/tennis_atp .
Please see https://github.com/JeffSackmann/tennis_atp/blob/master/matches_data_dictionary.txt for further information about the dataset features.
